# Key Questions:

- What are React components, and how do they help organize UI elements? Explain how props are used to pass data between components.
  - React components are reusable building blocks that encapsulate UI elements and their functionality. They help modularize an application's user interface. Props, short for "properties," are a way to pass data from parent to child components. They enable components to receive and use external data without affecting the parent's state.
- Describe how dynamic rendering is achieved using mapping. 
  - Mapping involves associating data with components or elements in your user interface. In dynamic rendering, mapping is used to establish a connection between the data you want to display and the components responsible for rendering that data. This can be done using data structures like arrays, objects, or other collections that store the necessary information.
